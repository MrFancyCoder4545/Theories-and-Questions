  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p><img src="https://bit.ly/2NtlnKN" style="float:right; width:600px; height:600px;">Hello, and welcome to my website. My name is Victor Lam and I thought that I'd tell you a little about myself. I'm a freshman at Shawsheen Valley Technical High School and am interested in taking the ISST/ISSN shop in my sophomore year. I'm the author of this website. I attended Marshall Simonds Middle School in Burlington and I am part of an amazing and welcoming skate team at the Gardner Veterans Arena. Being the only boy on an all girls' skate team has taught me a lot of things I wouldn't have ever expected to learn otherwise. I love being part of the team and being part of it with all of the amazing girls that accepted me despite me being a boy. I really try to be understanding of every person, and I tried my hardest to show that. In elementary school, I volunteered to help in the LABBB class, a special educational program for kids with learning disabilities. In the 8th grade, I continued to pursue this philosophy by joining the Teen Light Student Leadership Team, a program that raises money to help with nationwide issues concerning teens. My leadership team worked on teen depression and mental health with Riverside Community Care and several other local businesses all throughout Burlington. Another thing you should know about me is that I have changed a lot in my transfer to high school. For most of my life, I've found it very hard to open up about the emotions and thoughts I keep in my head.. I got bullied twice, lost many good friends, and endured many challenges and bumps to get to where I am today. Because of this, I've been trying to change and improve myself so that I don't let what happened to me reflect off onto other people. I hope what I encounter in my life can give you a new outlook on the things that occur before you everyday.<br><br><span style="font-family:cedarvilleCursive; color:white;">Victor Lam</span></p>
  <h2>Welcome!</h2>
  <p>Welcome to my new blog. I have designed this HTML website to give a better understanding of unanswered and often unnoticed questions in today's changing society. I'm hoping that my writing can reach out to anyone who reads it. My website works like this: I post a question and give my perspective on its answer. I accept any feedback on what questions you want me to answer as long as it doesn't afflict one of these humors: it offends me or any other student, if it is discriminatory towards any audience, if it is sexually explicit, or if it depicts any religious content, as that is a touchy subject.<br><br><b>Victor Lam</b></p>
  <h2>Why do we cry?</h2>
  <p>This is a very important question to me. I watched this video about a girl whose struggling father does all of these things that others see as bad and criminalistic just to support her. I thought to myself after seeing that video and it made me ask myself, why did I cry at that video? Why did that video in specific reach so far into my mind as to make me cry? All humans cry, whether it be a boy or girl, someone tough or someone a little more sensitive, or someone young or someone old; the reason why this question is so hard to answer is that we all cry for different reasons. To answer this question, I have to look at the world from not only my eyes, but everyone else's. For example, I cried at that video because the girl realizes that her father is endeavoring all of the pain and struggle because she's his daughter. I cried for the father, how he has a daughter that's counting on him for survival and he is taking on such a huge debt and suffering so he can give his daughter a future, a future unlike his own. The point being, crying is something that very few people realize as the most beautiful form of sadness anybody could experience. So, my theory on why we all cry is that we have the beautiful and scary ability to feel what others are feeling, but that's called empathy, and that's just human nature. We can't escape it, so we have to embrace it and use whatever sad or depressing experiences to help us see what's right in front of us everyday, a pretty good life. Tell me what you think about this question because I would really like to have different perspectives on this. Also, please tell me what other questions you want me to answer in the future.

  <h2>What is the difference between democrats and republicans?</h2>
  <p>The US has prided itself on its unique society and government for over 200 years. One major part of our government is our two major political parties: democratic and republican. These two parties exhibit little apparent differentiality with today's modernized government. Though, the two parties were derived from two older parties, the Federalists and the Democratic-Republicans. The Democratic-Republican party eventually became the Republican party, and the Federalist party became the Northern and Southern Democratic Party; the two parties merged afterwards into the modern Democratic party. Anyways, the Federalists wanted a strong central government and based its priorities on protecting America's budding industries. The Democratic-Republicans, or Anti-Federalists, believed that the federal government should leave them alone as much as possible; they wanted most of the power to fall in the hands of individual cities and states. The Federalists' ideals were passed onto the Democrats and the Democratic Republicans passed their ideals onto the Republicans. I feel like I overcomplicated this, but let me know what you think about it or you can suggest what other questions you want me to answer.<br><br><b>Victor Lam</b></p>
  <h2>What is the difference between "bathroom" and "restroom"?</h2>
  <p>The words, bathroom and restroom, have been used interchangably for quite some time now. All I can ask is why do they exist separately. My theory on it is that bathroom refers to a lavoratory within a place of residence and restroom refers to a lavoratory within a public space. I believe that a bathroom is called a bathroom because of its bath. Very few public restrooms have baths in them, if any at all. Restrooms would basically be a restroom, but within a public space, such as in malls, restaraunts, public pools, or any other public space. I can't really explain why it's a "rest" room, but I believe that it is also meant to take a break from walking or running around the public space. It isn't really that important to know whether you should say bathroom or restroom, I just thought it would be a fun question to answer. So, tell me if there are any other questions in mind that you would like me to answer.</p>

  <h1>Questions From My Old Blog</h1>
  <i>Disclaimer: My style of writing has changed a lot since I moved from my old blog to this new one. Please do not be offended if any of my content is derogatory in any way. I try my best to remain neutral on every level</i>
  <h2>What is in music that captivates so many people?</h2>
  <p>Music, the rhythmic combination of instrumental and vocal harmony, has captivated the attention of everyone. Sometimes for the better, instilling morals, and in some cases, helping instill facts for a quiz or test in a catchy and easily remembered way. My theory is that music gives an upbeat and jolly way of telling a story, but in today's modern world, people focus on the rhythmic part of music. I believe that people find the steady beat catchy, therefore creating interest in it. The beat stimulates emotions, like happiness, sadness, or even anger. Providing closure for any emotion they may be feeling. Let me know about what you think about what's in music that captivates so many people in the comments. <i>September 05, 2017</i></p>
  <h2>Why are there so many languages?</h2>
  <p>Since the development of civilization, people have been using language to communicate, and when they started venturing other continents, they kept their languages. If different people from different continents, why wouldn't they make a universal language to communicate? My theory on why they did this is because it would have taken too long to translate everything between the languages and to get the rest of the world to comply. Tell me what you think about why there are so many languages in the world in the comments. <i>June 25, 2017<i></p>
  <h2>Why have gender boundaries been put into society?</h2>
  <p>As civilization progressed, different genders began to assume different roles. Traditionally, men took care of the heavy work and provided for their families and women cared for their offspring. That was the beginning of gender boundaries. My theory is that human nature is very similar to an ant colony. Everyone felt like they have specific roles within society. Anyways, tell me what you think about why social boundaries have been put into society in the comments. <i>June 25, 2017</i> <br><b>Side Note</b>: I believe in gender equality and prefer going against what men are supposedly expected to do and how they're expected to act. As much as anyone would like to argue against this, there are still specific sports, colors, and actions that are labelled with a gender.</p>

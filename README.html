  <h2>Welcome!</h2>
  <p>Welcome to my new blog. I have designed this HTML website to give a better understanding of unanswered and often unnoticed questions in today's changing society. I'm hoping that my writing can reach out to anyone who reads it. My website works like this: I post a question and give my perspective on its answer. I accept any feedback on what questions you want me to answer as long as it doesn't afflict one of these humors: it offends me or any other student, if it is discriminatory towards any audience, if it is sexually explicit, or if it depicts any religious content, as that is a touchy subject.<br><br><b>Victor Lam</b></p>

  <h2>What is the difference between democrats and republicans?</h2>
  <p>The US has prided itself on its unique society and government for over 200 years. One major part of our government is our two major political parties: democratic and republican. These two parties exhibit little apparent differentiality with today's modernized government. Though, the two parties were derived from two older parties, the Federalists and the Democratic-Republicans. The Democratic-Republican party eventually became the Republican party, and the Federalist party became the Northern and Southern Democratic Party; the two parties merged afterwards into the modern Democratic party. Anyways, the Federalists wanted a strong central government and based its priorities on protecting America's budding industries. The Democratic-Republicans, or Anti-Federalists, believed that the federal government should leave them alone as much as possible; they wanted most of the power to fall in the hands of individual cities and states. The Federalists' ideals were passed onto the Democrats and the Democratic Republicans passed their ideals onto the Republicans. I feel like I overcomplicated this, but let me know what you think about it or you can suggest what other questions you want me to answer.<br><br><b>Victor Lam</b></p>
  <h1>Questions From My Old Blog</h1>
  <hr style="color:purple">
  <h2>What is in music that captivates so many people?</h2>
  <p>Music, the rhythmic combination of instrumental and vocal harmony, has captivated the attention of everyone. Sometimes for the better, instilling morals, and in some cases, helping instill facts for a quiz or test in a catchy and easily remembered way. My theory is that music gives an upbeat and jolly way of telling a story, but in today's modern world, people focus on the rhythmic part of music. I believe that people find the steady beat catchy, therefore creating interest in it. The beat stimulates emotions, like happiness, sadness, or even anger. Providing closure for any emotion they may be feeling. Let me know about what you think about what's in music that captivates so many people in the comments. <i>September 05, 2017</i></p>
  <h2>Why are there so many languages?</h2>
  <p>Since the development of civilization, people have been using language to communicate, and when they started venturing other continents, they kept their languages. If different people from different continents, why wouldn't they make a universal language to communicate? My theory on why they did this is because it would have taken too long to translate everything between the languages and to get the rest of the world to comply. Tell me what you think about why there are so many languages in the world in the comments. <i>June 25, 2017<i></p>
  <h2>Why have gender boundaries been put into society?</h2>
  <p>As civilization progressed, different genders began to assume different roles. Traditionally, men took care of the heavy work and provided for their families and women cared for their offspring. That was the beginning of gender boundaries. My theory is that human nature is very similar to an ant colony. Everyone felt like they have specific roles within society. Anyways, tell me what you think about why social boundaries have been put into society in the comments. <i>June 25, 2017</i> <br><b>Side Note</b>: I believe in gender equality and prefer going against what men are supposedly expected to do and how they're expected to act. As much as anyone would like to argue against this, there are still specific sports, colors, and actions that are labelled with a gender.</p>
